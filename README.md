# **Quietify - Audio Noise Reduction GUI**

Quietify is a PyQt5-based desktop application for reducing noise in audio files. It supports both individual audio files and batch processing of folders. The tool leverages **Librosa**, **PyDub**, and **NoiseReduce** to enhance the audio quality by minimizing background noise.

---

## **Features**
- Process individual `.wav` files or entire folders.
- Batch noise reduction to prevent memory overload.
- User-friendly GUI built with PyQt5.
- Customized styling for an intuitive user experience.
- Displays alerts for non-WAV files, empty selections, or missing inputs.
- Progress dialog to track audio processing in real-time.
